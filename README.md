This is analysis done on the employees database of the company Pewlett Hackard. The employees in the database were hired between 1985 and 2000.

As part of this analysis, I have created 6 new tables:   
3 master tables
- employee - Holds the list of employees and employee infomration like title, date of birth, hire date, etc 
- title - Holds the list of titles in the company and the corresponding codes.
- department

3 fact tables (department )

To access the data from jupyter notebook, one needs configure username and password in a "config.py" file and save it in the folder "code". Just add 2 lines as below:  

    username='username'  
    password='password'
